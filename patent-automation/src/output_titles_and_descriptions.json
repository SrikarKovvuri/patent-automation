        "description": "The invention relates to a process for preparing an ester mixture, in which an n-butene-containing feed mixture having a composition which changes over time is first oligomerized and then converted by hydroformylation, hydrogenation and esterification to an ester mixture. In this process, an approximation of the actual viscosity of the ester mixture is determined. The problem that it addresses is that of specifying a comparatively simple process which enables conversion of an n-butene with a variable composition over time to an ester mixture having a viscosity which can be kept very substantially constant over a long period even when an inconstant C4 source which delivers fluctuating qualities over this period is utilized. This is achieved through controlled use of a second raw material, namely ethene. It has been found that the viscosity of n-butene-based ester mixtures can be influenced by controlled use of ethene in the preparation of the ester precursors. Specifically, the invention proposes two measures by which the ethene can be used: either directly as C2 olefin or as C8 olefin after prior separate oligomerization.",

        "description": "Glucose deprivation is an attractive strategy in cancer research and treatment. Cancer cells upregulate glucose uptake and metabolism for maintaining accelerated growth and proliferation rates. Specifically blocking these processes is likely to provide new insights to the role of glucose transport and metabolism in tumorigenesis, as well as in apoptosis. As solid tumors outgrow the surrounding vasculature, they encounter microenvironments with a limited supply of nutrients leading to a glucose deprived environment in some regions of the tumor. Cancer cells living in the glucose deprived environment undergo changes to prevent glucose deprivation-induced apoptosis. Knowing how cancer cells evade apoptosis induction is also likely to yield valuable information and knowledge of how to overcome the resistance to apoptosis induction in cancer cells. Disclosed herein are novel anticancer compounds that inhibit basal glucose transport, resulting in tumor suppression and new methods for the study of glucose deprivation in animal cancer research.",

A broad range of infectious agents (e.g., bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites) and molecules (e.g., proteins, DNA, RNA, hormones, and drugs) can be detected by the methods. The invention enables rapid, ultra-sensitive, cost-effective, and portable assays. The ability of the invention to detect low levels of target molecules rapidly and cost-effectively results from the combination of high intensity labeling, formats that facilitate rapid reaction kinetics, and large area imaging based using either instrumentation made from off-the-shelf commercial components or no instrumentation at all.",

The bag is provided with at least one grout fill port for filling the bag by pumping cementitious grout into the bag.",

        "description": "A hydrostatic axial piston machine (1) utilizing a bent-axis construction has a driveshaft (4) with a drive flange (3) rotatable around an axis of rotation (Rt) inside a housing (2). A cylinder barrel (7) has pistons (10) fastened in an articulated manner to the drive flange (3). The drive flange (3) is supported on a housing-side slide face (101) by an axial bearing (100) in the form of a hydrostatically relieved sliding bearing (102) having a plurality of slippers (105). Each of the slippers (105) is mounted in an articulated manner in the drive flange (3) so that when the drive flange (3) rotates, a compensating force (FFR) acts on the slipper (105) which is in the opposite direction to the centrifugal force (FF) acting on the slipper (105). The point of application (AP) of the compensating force (FFR) on the slipper (105) is selected so that there is no tipping moment on the slipper (105) or to compensate for some or all of any tipping moment that does occur.",

        "description": "Axially protruding and centrally cool able pistons rotate within a cylindrical main chamber. Each piston is individually kinetically linked to a flywheel. As the pistons are individually accelerated and decelerated along their continuous rotating path, rotating volumes between them angularly expand and contract. Inlets and outlets communicate fluid in correspondence with expansion and contraction phases of the rotating volumes. A low number of moving parts, area sealed volumes, no valves, balanced mass forces, smooth rotation and short force transmission paths between opposing mass forces provide for lightweight construction and high rotational speeds. Radial sliding secondary pistons of the kinetic linkage modulate secondary rotating volumes adjacent the main chamber for a dual stage thermodynamically efficient engine operation with intermittent fluid cooling or heating. Inlets and/or outlets may be angularly changed for variable compression and/or combustion engine peak pressures, expansion end pressure, for brake energy recycling and burst mode engine operation.",
